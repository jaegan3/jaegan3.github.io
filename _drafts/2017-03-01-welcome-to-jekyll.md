Cage Data, a DevOps consulting firm and Managed Service Provider (MSP), helps clients like Charter Oak Financial Group and Bio-Techne build product delivery processes that rival the likes of fast-moving tech companies. Based in Wallingford, CT, right near the insurance capital of Hartford, the company is perfectly positioned to bring a progressive mindset to a big enterprise audience.  

Dave Long, Director of Development says, “Many local insurance companies and other large enterprises are looking at what’s coming out of Silicon Valley and other startup hubs, and want to get their products to market faster too but they don’t know how.” So Cage Data helps these companies build out their DevOps culture, practices, and tooling.

And it’s working. The company is growing fast, doubling in size and revenue year over year.
