As teams look to grow their DevOps practice, they face many fundamental challenges. Integrating Developer and Ops workflows provide massive lifts in efficiency, but require focused work. Continuous Deployment offers a step-function in development velocity, while requiring a sea-change in the way Ops manages systems. Sharing responsibility for Applications and Infrastructure across a wider team brings experiential benefits and integrates teams with historical silos. While sharing responsibility for infrastructure is great, the ugly truth of DevOps is that most people donâ€™t want to be on-call.
